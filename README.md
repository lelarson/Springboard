# Logan's Repository of Work for the Springboard Data Science Career Track

This is the repository for the work I completed to graduate from the [Springboard Data Science Career Track](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track). Within you'll find all code used to complete numerous mini-projects along with all data, documents and code used in producing two original capstone projects constructed during my time taking the course.
